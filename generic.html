								<p>Hi there! I'm Corina, a Toronto based detail-oriented Data Analyst with a Certificate in Data Analytics and a knack for pattern recognition, accuracy, and creativity. Understanding business goals and priorities has always been part of my work experience since I graduated and became a statistician. Gradually, I moved to other roles, such as project management in online marketing research and revenue analyst within the property management industry. Through my certification in data analytics, I delved deep into the world of Excel, Tableau, SQL and Python and effectively applied these technical skills in projects to turn data into actionable insights. I also successfully managed testing, data validation and accounting during a migration process, demonstrating my commitment to maintaining database accuracy and resolving data quality issues.</p>
								<p>What sets me apart in the data realm is my unique background in revenue accounting, research, financial and HR reporting, customer success, and managing multiple projects at different stages of execution combined with my education in Sociology, Statistics and Creative Writing. In my previous roles, I provided excellent customer service by understanding customer’s needs and translating insights into actionable strategies. I learned how to prioritize, solve unexpected problems, manage my time, and build strong relationships.</p>
								<p>For instance, as a project manager I brought teams together to collaborate on more than seventy online marketing research projects for large key accounts such as Lacoste, Ferrero Rocher and Kraft foods, I designed surveys and wrote technical specifications for programmers to build the survey web page and managed client expectations through proactive communication. In my roles as a revenue analyst within the property management industry priorities shifted all the time and, therefore, I continuously assessed and reprioritized tasks, solved unexpected problems and managed my time to meet the monthly deadlines. I analyzed weekly and month end reports, corrected discrepancies, trained cross-functional teams and, as a result, I improved operational efficiency, customer satisfaction, and reduced costs for a portfolio of 1800 accounts. </p>
								<p>Beyond the world of data, you will find me exploring a diverse range of passions. When I am not hiking across Ontario, I’m likely reading, writing, following and adjusting the pattern for a specific knitted project or swimming.</p>
								<p>I am excited to apply my unique blend of analytical, creative, research, customer-centric, and attention to details skills, pattern recognition and growth mindset along with my strong work ethic and passion for solving business requests by providing insights and clear visualizations.</p>
								<p>Let’s embark on this data adventure together. Feel free to connect with me.</p>
